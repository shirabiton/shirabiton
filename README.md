### Hi, I'm Shira
Welcome to my GitHub space ‚úåÔ∏è

## Overview
Since October 2024, I've been working as a Full Stack Developer in a civilian role within the Israel Defense Forces, specializing in the MERN stack.
<br>

In August 2024, I had the opportunity to mentor students at the educational institution where I studied, supporting them in their Java and React projects. Guiding them through technical challenges and seeing their progress was incredibly rewarding, and I feel it strengthened my teaching and mentoring skills.<br>

During that same month, I completed a Full Stack internship at Chip, a startup company, as part of my certificate program. Working in a team of 20 developers, I focused on version control tools like Git and GitHub. My work included C# for backend development, Angular with TypeScript for frontend, and SQL Server for the database.<br>

I've developed a variety of applications and Full Stack projects - feel free to explore them in my repositories below.<br>
