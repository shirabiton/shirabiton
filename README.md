### 👋 Hi, I am Shira
Welcome to my GitHub space ✌️

## 🌐 Overview
I am a Full Stack Developer in the IDF, specializing in the MERN stack, after completing an intensive three-and-a-half-month training program.
 🚀<br>

In addition to my technical work, last August I had the opportunity to assist students at the educational institution where I studied with their projects in Java and React. Guiding them through challenges and watching their progress was incredibly rewarding, and I feel it strengthened my teaching and mentoring skills. 👩‍🏫<br>

In July 2024, I completed an internship as a Full Stack developer at Chip- a startup company, as part of my certificate studies. Working within a team of 20 programmers, I focused on version control tools like Git and GitHub. My work primarily involved using C# for backend development and Angular for frontend, alongside SQL Server as the database. 🛠️<br>

I have developed several impressive projects, including client-server applications. You can check them out in the repositories below. 🔎<br>
