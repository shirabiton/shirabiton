### 👋 Hi, I'm Shira
Welcome to my GitHub space! 🚀


## 🌐 Overview
I just recently finished interning at a startup company called Chip - [@ChipRepo1](https://github.com/ChipRepo1) as a Full Stack Developer.<br> 
As part of a team of 20 programmers, I have mainly specialized in version control tools like Git and GitHub.<br>
I worked there primarily with C# for backend development and Angular for frontend, using SQL Server as a database.<br>

In addition to my technical work, I had the opportunity to assist students at the educational institution where I studied with their projects in Java and React.
It was gratifying to guide them through challenges and see their progress. This experience strengthened my training and teamwork skills.
