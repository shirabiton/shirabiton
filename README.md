### 👋 Hi, I am Shira
Welcome to my GitHub space ✌️

## 🌐 Overview
I am currently undergoing three and a half months of training with the IDF, preparing for my first job in the industry as a Full Stack Developer. As part of this training, I am working with various programming languages and tools, particularly focusing on the MERN stack, while building a professional project that will be deployed. I am enjoying the process, gaining hard and soft skills, and looking forward to starting my professional journey. 🚀<br>

In addition to my technical work, last August I had the opportunity to assist students at the educational institution where I studied with their projects in Java and React. Guiding them through challenges and watching their progress was incredibly rewarding, and I feel it strengthened my teaching and mentoring skills. 👩‍🏫<br>

In July 2024, I completed an internship as a Fullstack developer at Chip- a startup company, as part of my certificate studies. Working within a team of 20 programmers, I focused on version control tools like Git and GitHub. My work primarily involved using C# for backend development and Angular for frontend, alongside SQL Server as the database. 🛠️<br>

I have developed several impressive projects, including client-server applications. You can check the out in the repositories below.🔎<br>
